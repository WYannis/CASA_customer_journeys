# CASA_customer_journeys
Code written during my first internship, at Crédit Agricole S.A. from June 2018  to August 2018

There are different parts to this code, it is basically divided this way:

- extraction of the traffic data on www.crédit-agricole.fr from an external provider (APInternet)
- preparation and processing of the data
- identification of the most "relevant" customer journeys (so that the visualisation is clearer)
- clusterization of the graph (optional)
- visualisation with a Sankey Diagram (great to represent a flow of users)

Please note the code is not integral, and the data is not provided here, for obvious confidentiality reasons.
